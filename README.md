# BulletsAndWalls

3 bullet sprites spawn every few seconds and each of them are given a random speed between 223 and 321 and a random weight between 30 and 52.

The bullets move and hit a wall which has a random thickness between 22px and 83px , the damage caused is calculated by an algorithm which colours the walls according to the damage caused and determines if the wall is safe or not.

Not Safe = red      Safe = green
